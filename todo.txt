NICE TO HAVE
request specs
cancelling reservations
better user experience around unavailable tables / date selection
send mail in background job
stop doing janky things in reservations controller with params
feels like a real restaurant website and not the elemental plane of bootstrap
hide navbar from regular users (since they can't use it anyway)
responsive design
